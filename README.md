# dotfiles
Just my dotfiles for bash and vim, maybe some others later.

## .vimrc
Vim settings I use (primarily) for Salesforce development. ctrlp plugin should be downloaded and installed in `~/.vim`.

## .bashrc
This is my .bashrc for Ubuntu running under WSL, hence the alias for `start.exe` and some other quirks.
